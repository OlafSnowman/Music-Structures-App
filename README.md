This app is a multiscreen app that has musical genres and a few notable songs from that genre. Each screen uses a seperate XML layout file
and I also use another XML layout file to hold the song name and year in the given genre page. Clicking on one of the genres on the homepage
brings you to the genre page, where you can see a song and the year it was made. Clicking the home button will bring you to the main screen.
